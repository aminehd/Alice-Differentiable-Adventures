    "- **A**) Basically optimizer has an internal state. Modern optimizers like Adam, RMSProp, and momentum SGD track information beyond just the current parameters (e.g., moving averages of gradients, momentum buffers) . This historical information influences how parameters should be updated in future steps. For example, in momentum optimization, the opt_state contains the velocity vectors that determine the direction and magnitude of parameter updates. "
